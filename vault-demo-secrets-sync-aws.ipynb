    "# HashiCorp Vault Demo for Secrets Sync features.\n",
    "\n",
    "HashiCorp Vault's Secrets Sync feature manages the entire lifecycle of the secret and the secret is synchronized to the desired destination provider.  Applications will still be able to natively into the desired destination provider of choice.  This provides an easy way for applications to get the Zero Trust benefits of Vault without having to directly integrate with Vault.  i.e. Centralized secret inventory, audit and reporting, and automation of credential rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported destinations include\n",
    "- AWS Secrets Manager\n",
    "- Azure Key Vault\n",
    "- GCP Secret Manager\n",
    "- GitHub Repository Actions\n",
    "- Vercel Projects\n",

    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will show how key/value secrets that are stored in Vault's KV v2 Secret Engine are actively synchronized into an external target destination used by applications. If the secret value is updated in Vault, the secret is updated in the destination as well. If the secret is deleted from Vault, it is deleted on the external system as well. This process is asynchronous and event-based. Vault propagates modifications into the proper destinations automatically in a few seconds.\n",

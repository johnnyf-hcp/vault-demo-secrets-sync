    "# HashiCorp Vault Demo for Secrets Sync\n",
    "\n",
    "HashiCorp Vault's Secrets Sync feature manages the entire lifecycle of the secret and the secret is synchronized to the desired destination provider.  Applications will still be able to natively integrate with the desired destination provider of choice.  This provides an easy way for applications to get the Zero Trust benefits of Vault without having to directly integrate with Vault.  i.e. Centralized secret inventory, audit and reporting, and automation of credential rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported destinations include\n",
    "- AWS Secrets Manager\n",
    "- Azure Key Vault\n",
    "- GCP Secret Manager\n",
    "- GitHub Repository Actions\n",
    "- Vercel Projects\n",

    "<img src=\"images/vault-demo-secrets-sync.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will show how key/value secrets that are stored in Vault's KV v2 Secret Engine are actively synchronized into cloud native secret providers on AWS, Azure, and GCP. As a secret is rotated in Vault, the secret is updated to the cloud native secret provider as well.  If the secret is deleted from Vault, it is deleted on the cloud native secret provider as well. This process is asynchronous and event-based. Vault propagates modifications into the proper destinations automatically in a few seconds.\n",
